        <h1>Recycle</h1>

        <p>Recycling is one of the easiest things you can do. Given all the plastic that's around in the world, it's
          easy to pick up another plastic bag at a supermarket. But it's even easier to be prepared with your own, more
          sustainable bag. Plastic will continue to have its place in our world, but that makes it that much more
          important that we strive not to add to its pollution.</p>

      <div class="columns">
        <h1>Planting</h1>

        <p>The environment gives so much to us, planting is the best way to give back. Not just to the environment, but
          to ourselves too. From absorbing carbon emissions to just adding to a nice view in a park, nature is surely
          more than a breath of fresh air. Planting, even just taking care of a small tulip, will brighten your
          environment, and in turn everyone else's.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="columns">
        <h1>Be Sustainable</h1>

        <p>This is more of a mindset than a method or clear-cut action to take, but it is the most important part of
          helping the environment - arguably because it's not only benefitting nature, but also yourself. Using what you
          already have and making the most of it instead of making a purchase for something new will help you be kinder
          to nature - and your wallet.</p>
